### This is a repository for the OMSD transpose_xml() function and Demonstration for OpenSheetMusicDisplay

[opensheetmusicdisplay.org](https://opensheetmusicdisplay.org/)

OpenSheetMusicDisplay renders MusicXML sheet music in the browser. It is the missing link between MusicXML and VexFlow. Built upon many years of experience in both sheet music interactivity and engraving, it is the perfect solution for app developers seeking to build digital sheet music services.
